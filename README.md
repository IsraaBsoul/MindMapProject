# MindMapProject

## Background and Motivation

 This project was developed as part of my studies for my degree at the university of Haifa, under the supervision of Professor Roi Poranne  and Professor Yotam Hod. The goal of MindMapProject is to create an interactive real-time mind mapping tool that enables users to visually organize their thoughts, structure ideas, and collaborate efficiently.

With Firebase's real-time database and Firestore, the project ensures instant updates, allowing multiple users to work on a mind map simultaneously. This project leverages JavaScript and Firebase for a smooth and responsive user experience.


## Project Overview

The MindMapProject provides a real-time collaborative platform where users can create, edit, and manage mind maps dynamically. The system allows multiple users to work together in real time, ensuring an interactive and seamless experience. Users can add descriptions, rename nodes and edges, attach links, and manage access through unique map IDs.

Key functionalities include:

Real-time collaboration: Instant updates with Firebase Realtime Database.  
Access control with unique Map IDs: Ensuring only authorized users can join specific maps.  
User authentication: Secure login and account management.  
Visualization & organization tools: Drag-and-drop node positioning, renaming, linking, and more.  
Live participant tracking: See who is currently working on the mind map.  
Cloud synchronization: Auto-save and retrieval of mind maps from Firebase.  

This tool is designed for students, professionals, and teams who need a structured approach to brainstorming, project planning, and knowledge management.
